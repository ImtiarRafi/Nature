    <h1> Forest </h1>
    Forests are among the most vital ecosystems, home to approximately 80% of terrestrial species and essential for carbon storage. Tropical rainforests like the Amazon, Congo, and Southeast Asian rainforests absorb significant amounts of carbon dioxide, acting as natural carbon sinks that help mitigate climate change. Forests also play a vital role in the water cycle by releasing moisture into the atmosphere, which then falls as rain, sustaining rivers and lakes. Beyond these ecological functions, forests provide numerous resources for humans, such as timber, medicine, and food. Forests are also revered in many cultures as sacred places, representing peace, mystery, and the unknown.
