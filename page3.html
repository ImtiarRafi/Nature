    <h1> Ocean</h1>
    Covering over 70% of the Earth’s surface, oceans are the largest and most mysterious of ecosystems, supporting a wealth of biodiversity and regulating global climate. Oceans absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide, helping to moderate Earth’s temperature. They also play a crucial role in the water cycle, as seawater evaporates to form clouds that eventually bring rain. Marine ecosystems are home to diverse life forms, from microscopic plankton to massive whales. Coral reefs, sea grass beds, and kelp forests provide habitat and food for marine species and protect coastlines from erosion. However, oceans face threats such as plastic pollution, overfishing, and climate change, which disrupt these ecosystems and the many communities that depend on them.
