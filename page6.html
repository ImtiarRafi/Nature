    <h2> Conservation of Nature </h2>
    In light of the many threats to nature, conservation efforts have become increasingly important. Organizations and governments worldwide are working to protect endangered species, restore degraded ecosystems, and implement sustainable practices. Conservation programs often focus on protecting key habitats, such as rainforests and coral reefs, and on preserving biodiversity through wildlife reserves, national parks, and marine protected areas. Sustainable practices, including renewable energy sources, sustainable agriculture, and waste reduction, aim to reduce human impact on nature and promote a balance between development and environmental preservation. Individuals can also contribute by adopting sustainable lifestyles, supporting conservation initiatives, and raising awareness about environmental issues.
